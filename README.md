# Copeland Search for Combinatorial Optimization Research

During Summer 2022, I was selected for the prestigious Mitacs RISE-Globalink Award in partnership with the German Academic Exchange Service. This fellowship allowed me to work with Dr. Alexander Schiendorfer in the Learning and Optimization in Manufacturing Lab. My project focused on developping improvements for multicriteria optimization using Pareto-improvements and Condorcet voting from computational social choice theory. I developed Copeland and Pareto constraints in modelling software MiniZinc which were then integrated into an iterative search algorithm in Python.
